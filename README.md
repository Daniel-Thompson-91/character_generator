Codecademy Project: Character Generator

The goal of this project is to utilize current knowledge of JavaScript to create a random character generator, and use my current knowledge of Git and GitHub to host the program on my GitHub page.

What is Character Generator?
This program will generate a random character with brief backstory every time it is run by the user. The races, environments, and hobbies are all randomly generated each time the generateCharacter() function is called.

How to use program?
This program is 100% javaScript. In order to use it you will need to copy the file locally and run it with Node.js. When you call the function generateCharacter(), it should generatete random character details.
