# Codecademy Project: Character Generator

The goal of this project is to utilize current knowledge of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** to create a random character generator, and use my current knowledge of **Git** and **GitHub** to host the program on my GitHub page.

## What is Character Generator?
This program will generate a random character with brief backstory every time it is run by the user. The races, environments, and hobbies are all randomly generated each time the **generate** button is clicked.
