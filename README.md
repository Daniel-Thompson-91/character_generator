Codecademy Project: Character Generator

The goal of this project is to utilize current knowledge of JavaScript to create a random character generator, and use my current knowledge of Git and GitHub to host the program on my GitHub page.

What is Message Generator?
This program will generate a random character with brief backstory every time it is run by the user. It will consisit of a basic HTML file which will contain static text, a Stylesheet to ensure the file is pleasant to look at, and a JavaScript file to generate the randomized elements of the character description.
